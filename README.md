# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

This project is a database system for managing the inventory of an ecommerce business. 
It allows users to track products, manage sales, and analyze inventory performance.


## Process
Loading csv Files into Database
removed duplicates in primary keys 
(fullvisitorid and productsku)

## Results
i discovered that all the tables are related on the primary keys. and this facilitated qurying the data and drawing answers to the questions

## Challenges 
Loading the data in pg admin was a challenge because i did it wrong and spent some days trying to do some queries and couldn't,
i had to restart the process

## Future Goals
I would work on cleaning the whole data and present it in the best shape possible
